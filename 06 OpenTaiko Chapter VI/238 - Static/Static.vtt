00:05.053 --> 00:07.263
One two three, tap your feet

00:07.263 --> 00:10.105
Such a classic melody

00:10.105 --> 00:12.316
One two three, you know the words

00:12.316 --> 00:15.158
So sing along with me!

00:15.158 --> 00:17.368
One two three, motley scenes

00:17.368 --> 00:20.211
Shining through the silver screen

00:20.211 --> 00:22.421
One two three, dontcha think

00:22.421 --> 00:25.263
This is how it ought to be?

00:25.263 --> 00:27.158
Just another day, throw your cares away

00:27.158 --> 00:29.053
And laugh hand-in-hand with me!

00:29.053 --> 00:30.947
Just another day,

00:30.947 --> 00:31.895
It’sjustanotherdayit’sjustanotherdayit's–

00:31.895 --> 00:35.053
One two three, what’s the nicest thing you see?

00:35.053 --> 00:37.895

00:37.895 --> 00:39.158
It’s me!!!!!!!!!!

00:39.158 --> 00:44.211
The world you know, always running to and fro

00:44.211 --> 00:49.263
A frightful place to be

00:49.263 --> 00:54.000
But don’t be scared, I’m not going anywhere!

00:54.000 --> 00:59.684
So just don’t touch the dial and stay here awhile with me!

00:59.684 --> 01:01.263
Panic! In static! Out-manic!

01:01.263 --> 01:04.737
Don’t you find it all romantic, the way things used to be?

01:04.737 --> 01:06.474
Classic, ecstatic, it’s magic

01:06.474 --> 01:09.474
To trip the light fantastic, repeat it after me!

01:09.474 --> 01:11.842
This is how it should be, in studio seats

01:11.842 --> 01:14.526
My ego wired in the CRT

01:14.526 --> 01:15.789
We can skip the sign-off

01:15.789 --> 01:17.368
Ol' familiar scene, repeating

01:17.368 --> 01:19.895
This is how it should be!

01:19.895 --> 01:25.277

01:25.277 --> 01:27.573
When you go,

01:27.573 --> 01:31.102
Just don’t change the channel

01:31.102 --> 01:36.749
I hope you won’t be long

01:36.749 --> 01:38.867
After all

01:38.867 --> 01:42.043
I want to be wanted

01:42.043 --> 01:47.573
Is that so wrong?

01:47.573 --> 01:49.573

01:49.573 --> 01:51.152
Panic! In static! Out-manic!

01:51.152 --> 01:54.625
Don’t you find it all romantic, the way things used to be?

01:54.625 --> 01:56.362
Classic, ecstatic, it’s magic

01:56.362 --> 01:59.362
To trip the light fantastic, repeat it after me!

01:59.362 --> 02:01.731
This is how it should be, in studio seats

02:01.731 --> 02:04.415
My ego wired in the CRT

02:04.415 --> 02:05.678
We can skip the sign-off

02:05.678 --> 02:07.257
Ol' familiar scene, repeating

02:07.257 --> 02:09.468
This is how it should be!

02:09.468 --> 02:11.836
This is how it should be, in studio seats

02:11.836 --> 02:14.520
My ego wired in the CRT

02:14.520 --> 02:15.783
We can skip the sign-off

02:15.783 --> 02:17.362
Ol' familiar scene, repeating

02:17.362 --> 02:19.889
This is how it should be!

02:19.889 --> 02:27.468

02:27.468 --> 02:29.000
This is how it should be.
