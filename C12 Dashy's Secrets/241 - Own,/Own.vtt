00:32.713 --> 00:35.426
<c.white.bg_red>Just like a rainy day, hiding the light

00:35.426 --> 00:38.936
<c.white.bg_red>Behind that strange smile wiped on my face

00:38.936 --> 00:42.447
<c.white.bg_red>is a truth we leave encased.

00:42.926 --> 00:45.638
<c.white.bg_red>Past 8:00 again, your "sunny day"

00:45.638 --> 00:49.149 
<c.white.bg_red>That world's hiding so much to it's core

00:49.149 --> 00:52.181  
<c.white.bg_red>But here, what are you looking for?

00:52.181 --> 00:54.73
<c.white.bg_red>"Between all our starts all the way to the end,

00:54.73 --> 00:57.287
<c.white.bg_red>(These) connections so crucial, they make you."

00:57.287 --> 00:59.840
<c.white.bg_red>From "ribbons" to truths to the stories you tell--

00:59.840 --> 01:02.234
<c.white.bg_red>I just want to keep what's sincere.

01:02.553 --> 01:07.660
<c.white.bg_red>(clockwork painted skies,)

01:07.660 --> 01:12.766
<c.white.bg_red>(ribbons of the world I see.)

01:12.766 --> 01:17.872
<c.white.bg_red>(please now, no more lies.)

01:17.872 --> 01:22.979
<c.white.bg_red>(...here until the end of time.)

01:22.979 --> 01:25.532
<c.white.bg_black>[solem et lunam, grisei coloris]


01:28.085 --> 01:32.234
<c.white.bg_red>Endlessly, a storm of fainted hues--

01:32.234 --> 01:37.660
<c.white.bg_red>I stay here wondering if I'll construe my words to you.

01:37.660 --> 01:42.447 
<c.white.bg_red>The gears of the world, forever spinning skies,

01:42.447 --> 01:48.511
<c.white.bg_red>"To reminisce" will always be in my own eyes.
